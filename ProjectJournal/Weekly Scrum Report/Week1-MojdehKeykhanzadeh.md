#Weekly Scrum Report 

Date: 7/15/2018 to 7/22/2018

##Daily stand-up questions

•	What tasks did I work on / complete?
I analyzed project requirements and thought of design pattern and framework to use. Then discussed the architectural diagram and design pattern with the team. We decided to go with Spring MVC for implementing API, MongoDB for persistent data and android for front end.  I started with DB design for payment API and then implementing a REST API to enable payments. I completed payment API and tested through postman successfully.

•	What am I planning to work on next?
I am planning to create Mockup for Android UI screens as well as implementing Payment screen. I also need to figure out how to use Volley to expose Spring REST API to Android app. I will also help the team on deployment. 

•	What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
N/A

##XP Core Values

•	Communication
We had an effective week of communication to be on top of project and deliver efficiently. We started the week with brainstorming about ideas before starting discussing and finalizing our architectural diagram and design pattern. We constantly communicating and kept each other in the loop a head of time. This way, our daily scrum were more efficient and focused .
