Avleen Singh Khanuja's Weekly Scrum Report for Week 2:

What tasks did I work on / complete? 
I completed writing the Manage Order API by implementing the functionality to manage orders that a user places by persisting the order data in the MongoDB NoSQL database which is cloud based. I used SpringBoot Framework wherein inside the application and the API, I created a Mongo Repository and defined a function to retrieve the Total Bill amount for an order placed by the user and pass that Total Bill Amount to the Payments API to move ahead with Payment Processing. I tested the API end-to-end and it is working in Docker on an AWS Container.

What am I planning to work on next? I am planning to present the project along with my team to demonstrate the working APIs and will wait for feedback.

XP Core Values throughout the project "Courage" While selecting a framework that was completely new to all our team members that we had never used before, we were taking a risk with such short given time. but, one should show courage and take up challenges as when they come and we did that and succeded quite well until now.
