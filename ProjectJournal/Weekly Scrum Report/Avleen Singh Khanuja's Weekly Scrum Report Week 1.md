Avleen Singh Khanuja's Weekly Scrum Report for Week 1:
1. What tasks did I work on / complete? I commenced by exploring some frameworks like Spring to write a REST API in Java on the Internet and found out after some research that using SpringBoot, REST APIs can be easy to write. For persisting the data of the API somewhere, I along with my team chose MongoDB because the use case and the functionality of our APIs need fast searching where NoSQL databases fit perfectly.With cloud in trend, we chose to move forward with cloud based MongoDB which is mLab. Then, I started writing the Java code for my Manage Orders REST API following the MVC design pattern.


2. What am I planning to work on next? Using Spring framework to write REST API as well as DEsign Patterns are new concepts for me so I am ready to face challenges. I am planning to first complete my Manage Order API by writing the complete functionality as well as testing the API end-to-end using Postman. Then, once my API is fully functional and I am able to perform Database Operations with MongoDB, I will try to deploy the API into Docker Container.
What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member? Integration of various code and dependency of various modules on other modules/APIs usually happens while working in teams.


3. XP Core Values throughout the project "Courage" While selecting a framework that was completely new to all our team members that we had never used before, we were taking a risk with such short given time. but, one should show courage and take up challenges as when they come and we did that and succeded quite well until now.
