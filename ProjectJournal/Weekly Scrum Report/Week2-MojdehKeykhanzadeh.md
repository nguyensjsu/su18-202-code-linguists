# Daily stand-up questions
What tasks did I work on / complete? I worked on integrating payment API with whole application. I also finished UI mockups and created Android application with basic payment screen. I successfully send a REST call via Volley to post payment. However, time did not allow me to complete UI ss learning new technology in my case Volley requires some amount of time to research. 

What am I planning to work on next? Complete UI  as my personal project

Feedback 
Feedback was a key role in my success in integrating my API with other APIs.  As testing my API, I noticed 
that I need some functionality from other part of application and getting feedback on how we can
improve the design and quality of overall application was contributing to successful completion.
